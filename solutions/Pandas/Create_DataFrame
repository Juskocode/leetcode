## Problem Description

Write a solution to create a DataFrame from a 2D list called `student_data`. This 2D list contains the IDs and ages of some students.

The resulting DataFrame should have two columns: `student_id` and `age`. The data should be in the same order as provided in the original 2D list.

### Input

A 2D list called `student_data`, where each element is a list with two items:
- `student_id` (integer): The ID of a student.
- `age` (integer): The age of the student.

### Output

A DataFrame with two columns:
- `student_id`
- `age`

The order of data should match the input list.

### Example

```python
student_data = [
    [101, 21],
    [102, 22],
