### Problem Description

You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, `n`. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least `n` intervals due to cooling time.

Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.
