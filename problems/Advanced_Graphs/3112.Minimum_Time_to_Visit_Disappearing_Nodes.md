### Problem Description

There is an undirected graph of `n` nodes. You are given a 2D array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, length_i]` describes an edge between node `u_i` and node `v_i` with a traversal time of `length_i` units.

Additionally, you are given an array `disappear`, where `disappear[i]` denotes the time when the node `i` disappears from the graph and you won't be able to visit it.

Notice that the graph might be disconnected and might contain multiple edges.

Return the array `answer`, with `answer[i]` denoting the minimum units of time required to reach node `i` from node 0. If node `i` is unreachable from node 0 then `answer[i]` is -1.
