# 1584. Min Cost to Connect All Points

## Problem Description

You are given an array points representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`.

The cost of connecting two points `[xi, yi]` and `[xj, yj]` is the Manhattan distance between them: `|xi - xj| + |yi - yj|`, where `|val|` denotes the absolute value of `val`.

Return the minimum cost to make all points connected. All points are connected if there is exactly one simple path between any two points.
