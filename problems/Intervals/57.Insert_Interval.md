### Problem Description

You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represents the start and the end of the ith interval, and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `start_i`. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by `start_i` and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return `intervals` after the insertion.

Note that you don't need to modify `intervals` in-place. You can make a new array and return it.
